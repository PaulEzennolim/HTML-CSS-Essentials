    <h1><u>Accessibility</u></h1>
    <h4>Visual disabilities</h4>
  <p>I made sure to make my text large and I used colours that contrast well.
    8% of the world suffer from colour blindness so making my text readable was a key aspect of my 
    accessibility approach.</p> 
  <P>I also included alternative text for all my images</P>
  <p>Navigation was also made easy to assist with visual disabilities. I put things like headers and links 
    places that are easy to see.
  </p>
  <h4>Auditory disabilities</h4>
  <p>Users might not be able to hear sounds or listen to videos. I made interactions only pictorial 
    because of this.
  </p>
  <h4>Cognitive disabilities</h4>
  <p>Cognitive disabilities affect users in that they may struggle with complex layouts or navigation 
    menus. To help with this i made the layout of my website simple, so that all people can navigate around 
    it easily.
    <h4>Speech disabilities</h4>
    <p>Users might not be able to communicate with organisations when on the website 
      there is just a telephone number. So to help with this i provided alternative ways to 
      contact the committee, such as email/form/chat etc.
      </p>
    <h4>Accessibility handled by other software</h4>
    <p>Screen readers: Software like Jaws, NVDA and voiceover read aloud the text on screen. This will help users with visual disabilities 
      to navigate the content
    </p>
    <p>Speech recognition software: Windows speech recognition allows users to contol a computer using voice commands, which may 
      help people who have limited mobility
